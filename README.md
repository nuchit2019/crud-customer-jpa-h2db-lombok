# Project CRUD Customer

## Overview
This project implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing customers. It provides endpoints to interact with customer data via HTTP requests.

## Classes

1. **ApiResponse**: This class represents a generic API response structure containing status, message, and data fields.

2. **Customer**: The Customer class represents the entity for storing customer data. It includes properties like id, name, and email.

3. **CustomerController**: CustomerController class defines RESTful API endpoints for handling customer-related operations.

4. **CustomerRepository**: CustomerRepository interface extends JpaRepository and provides methods for database operations on the Customer entity.

5. **CustomerService**: CustomerService interface defines methods for business logic related to customer operations.

6. **CustomerServiceImpl**: CustomerServiceImpl class implements the CustomerService interface. It contains the business logic for customer operations.

## Dependencies

- **Lombok**: Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating getters, setters, constructors, etc.
  
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: JPA is a standard interface for Java application persistence, allowing developers to interact with databases using object-oriented methods.

- **H2 Database**: H2 is a lightweight, in-memory database that can be used during development and testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Spring Boot provides a robust framework for building and running Java-based applications with minimal configuration.

- **RESTful API**: RESTful architecture is used to design the API endpoints, allowing clients to interact with the server using HTTP methods.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the project repository.
   
2. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your system.

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

4. Build the project using Maven:

mvn clean install

5. Run the application:

java -jar target/your-application-name.jar

6. The application should now be running locally. You can access the API endpoints as defined in the CustomerController class.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /customers**: Retrieve all customers.
- **GET /customers/{id}**: Retrieve a customer by ID.
- **POST /customers**: Create a new customer.
- **PUT /customers/{id}**: Update an existing customer.
- **DELETE /customers/{id}**: Delete a customer by ID.

## Sample Request and Response

**Request:**
```json
POST /customers
{
"name": "John Doe",
"email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
Response:
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Customer created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  }
}
Testing
Unit tests and integration tests should be written to ensure the correctness of the application logic and API endpoints. Mockito can be used for mocking dependencies during testing.

Deployment
The application can be deployed to various environments like local servers, cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku), or containerized using Docker. Ensure proper configuration and security measures are in place before deployment.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Implement CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
